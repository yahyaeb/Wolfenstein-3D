## 📝 Description
Libft is a project at 42 that involves creating a personal C library by implementing a collection of standard functions from the C standard library, as well as some additional utility functions. As my cursus progresses and new challenges arise, I have decided to expand this library to enhqnce its functionality and versatility by adding additional functions to meet specific project needs or explore some concepts in depth (bitwise operations with LIBBIN, sorting algorithms with LIBSORT...).

## 📥 Installation
To use this project locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/jack-pepper/mylibft.git
   ```

2. Run make to compile the library libft.a:
   ```bash
   make
   ```

3. Include the library to your project files:
   ```bash
   #include "libft.h"
   ```

## 🕹️ Usage
1. mylibft is designed to be modular, so you can easily add or remove functions and/or libraries depending on your needs.
2. Functions that were part of the libft project at 42 are prefixed with [42].
