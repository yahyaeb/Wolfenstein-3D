# üïπÔ∏è cub3D / Wolfenstein-3D

A raycasting-based 3D engine inspired by Wolfenstein 3D, written in C using MiniLibX. The goal is to create a navigable world for practicing ray casting fundamentals. There are no characters, collectibles, or advanced gameplay elements‚Äîjust pure ray casting and exploration.

## Customization

You can easily customize your game experience:

- **Colors**: Edit floor and ceiling colors directly in the `.cub` config file.
- **Map Editing**: Modify map layouts and elements by editing the map files in the `maps/` directory. Make sure your map meets the requirements: it must have exactly one player starting position (facing N, S, W, or E), and the map should be fully surrounded by walls.
- **Textures**: Change walls textures by replacing or adding files in the `ass/` folder and updating the paths in the config file. Textures must be ".xpm" files.
